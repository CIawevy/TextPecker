And I’ve tried many, many deodorants.\nI don’t know if I sweat weird or what, but it’s not been easy finding a deodorant that works well for me. Sorry if that’s an overshare, but it is a testament to how good this stuff is!\nI also want to say that if you’re already a fan of charcoal deodorant, of the various ones I’ve tried, this is my favorite.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/Cleo%2BCoco/page/4BA1E2B1-8FEA-49CA-AC37-F2B53ED9B70F?ref_=ast_bln\nKelitch Bracelet\nI’m linking the shop here:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/KELITCH/page/B022E865-341A-47D0-88BB-F9B1730BE277?ref_=ast_bln\nVery well priced, cute, a lot of variety. By the way, have only ever purchased bracelets, they are great, but I can’t vouch for any of their other products.\nI have bought a couple of bracelets from Kelitch, these are most recent:\nLifestraw Pitcher\nEnjoying this water filter pitcher that I purchased last week; although I’m thinking I should have bought the 10 cup rather than the 7.\nNice aesthetics, and different options and styles available for the pitchers: plastic, glass, sizes, colors.\nHere’s a screenshot of the one I bought, linked just below the picture.\nLifestraw has plenty of other products available as well, if you’re a camper I’d definitely check out their filtration systems.\nBudget Book\nI’m one of those people who likes to write things down. There are tons of budgeting apps, but I prefer the old fashioned way of tracking my spending.\nNothing too earthshattering here, but it looks nice, the layout is simple and straightforward, and there are charts etc as well should you like to use them (I never do).\nIt’s also less than $15, which I think is pretty good. I took a lot of time trying to find the “perfect” budgeting tracker book, and this is the one that I ended up picking. Definitely recommend!\nMonthly & Weekly Budget Planner Organizer – Financial Budgeting Book & Expense Tracker – Control Your Finances – Undated Start Anytime, 12 Months https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LB7NP69/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fab_uatAFbTKQXY8G\nLast but not least:\nEssential oil storage box:\nThis is SO great. Very simple, very useful, and very well made\nComes with stickers as well for labeling bottles. As you can see, this doesn’t fit larger bottles of oil. But that’s fine for me; the small bottles of oil are always the ones that end up in a mess and I can’t find what I’m looking for!\nThis has really been helpful in keeping organized. Here’s the link: Essential Oil Wooden Box – Oils Storage Case Holds 68 Bottles & Roller Balls. Natural Pine Wood. Large Organizer Best for Keeping Your Oils Safe. Includes Padding and EO Labels https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A07QAEC/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fab_p.wAFbS5CKPXS\nSo there you have it, some of my favorite Amazon buys of recent.

I am a firm believer of the LOA. Here is my magical story.\nI have been using a 6 to 7 year old laptop and for sometime now, about the last 6 months, my laptop started giving me a problem with its keypad. Four to five keys on my laptop’s keyboard stopped working. I had lot of trouble using it but somehow I was still managing it. I prayed to the Universe to fix this problem like magic. I then just forgot that I had asked for this to God and the Universe and I was using all the time just the way it was.\nGuess what?!! After all these months, just today, my laptop’s keys started functioning perfectly! Just as if it had got repaired by an engineer or perhaps the Universe itself! This is not with just one key but all the keys started working smoothly and the problem disappeared just like magic.\nI am very, very thankful and I am in total awe with the works of the Universe and God. This may sound like a small thing but this is a teaching to me and to all of us that when we believe and let go of our doubts and feel blessed with all that is given to us, the Universe is bound to deliver everything that we ask for.
